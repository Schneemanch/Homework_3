Because of this the expected return on betting $1 on this die being a six is E(X) = (.15844156 * 3) + (.84155844 * -1) = .47532468 -.84155844. Which results in an expected loss of -.36623376.\n",

With the loaded die the expected return is E(X) = (.52173913 * 3) + (.47826087 * -1) = 156521739 - .47826087. Which results in an expected winnings of 1.08695652.\n",

We could of course drastically improve our chances if we could have our computer near us and only bet when the last predicted state was from a loaded die however I don't think the dealer would approve...\n",

    "It should be noted that using the basic mathematical approach there are two variables that change these values \n",

    "1) The probability at which the dice are swapped would change the distribution of expected losses and winnings I'm not positive on the calculation of how much but it is known that the possibilty of changing from the loaded to the fair die is approximately 3 times more likely than the fair changing to loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) We know that the first die is fair thus the exact values of probability for the first die, as recorded in matrix E, are more likely to all be .166667 or 1/6 as the number of times the dealer rolls the first die approaches zero. Because of this slight change our first calculation of expected loss becomes approximately -.333333\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusting for 1) and 2) should give us a new figure 1.08695652 - .3333333 * 3 which would still get us an expected return of .08696 which is still a net gain even if it is abysmal.\n",
